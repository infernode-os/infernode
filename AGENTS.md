# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

InferNode is a mixed C, Limbo, shell, and Go repository. Core runtime and kernel code lives in `libinterp/`, `emu/port/`, and `libsec/`. Limbo applications and libraries live under `appl/`, with notable areas in `appl/cmd/`, `appl/veltro/`, and `appl/xenith/`. Interface definitions belong in `module/*.m`. Tests are under `tests/`, with emulator tests named `*_test.b` and host-side shell tests in `tests/host/*_test.sh`. Supporting material lives in `docs/`, `formal-verification/`, and `tools/godis/`.

## Design Principles

Prefer Inferno / Plan 9 style solutions. Keep interfaces simple, file-oriented, and composable; avoid unnecessary JSON, policy layers, or framework-heavy mediation. Namespace boundaries are the primary capability mechanism, so changes to Veltro, `tools9p`, mounts, and exported services should preserve truthful namespace restriction, attenuation, and direct text protocols.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use the platform scripts instead of inventing local build flows.

- `./build-linux-amd64.sh` or `./build-linux-arm64.sh`: standard Linux builds.
- `./build-linux-amd64.sh headless`: Linux build without SDL3.
- `./build-macos-sdl3.sh` or `./build-macos-headless.sh`: macOS builds.
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build-windows-amd64.ps1`: Windows build.
- `cd appl/cmd && mk install`: rebuild one Limbo subtree and install tracked runtime output into `dis/`.
- `cd tests && mk install && cd ..`: rebuild Limbo tests into the tracked runtime tree.
- `./run-tests.sh`: run host and emulator tests.
- `./run-tests.sh -h` or `./run-tests.sh -i -v`: run only host tests, or only emulator tests with verbose output.
- `./emu/<Platform>/o.emu -r. /tests/runner.dis -v`: run the native Limbo test runner directly when working inside the emulator workflow.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Match the surrounding code closely. Limbo (`.b`) is close to Go in structure but should follow existing Inferno idioms, naming, and control-flow style. C uses Plan 9 / Inferno conventions and tabs, not generic modern C house styles. Shell scripts should stay POSIX `sh` compatible. Name new emulator tests `*_test.b`, host tests `*_test.sh`, and keep module interfaces in `module/` aligned with their implementation names.

Use Inferno `mk`, not GNU make, for subtree builds. In `mkfile`s, do not chain commands with `&&`; use separate rules or `;`.

## Testing Guidelines

Behavior changes should include tests. Prefer the repository’s Limbo test setup instead of ad hoc harnesses: build tests with `mk install`, then run them through `tests/runner.dis` or `./run-tests.sh`. Host integration checks belong in `tests/host/`. If a change regenerates runtime `.dis` files under `dis/`, make sure they result from `mk install` in the corresponding source directory rather than manual edits.

## Security Review Priorities

Model threats in this order unless a task says otherwise:

- adversarial or prompt-injected AI agents running inside InferNode via the Veltro harness
- sophisticated remote automated attackers attempting protocol or emulator compromise
- attacks on communication and cryptographic protocols

When proposing fixes, prefer namespace, mount, process-group, file-permission, and protocol-shape solutions over bolted-on policy code.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history uses scoped, imperative subjects such as `fix(theme): ...`, `build: ...`, and `test: ...`. Keep the first line under 72 characters, explain why in the body when needed, and reference issue IDs like `INFR-28` when relevant. PRs should stay focused, describe the motivation, include test coverage, update docs for interface changes, and include screenshots for UI work in Lucia/Xenith.
