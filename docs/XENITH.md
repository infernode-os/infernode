# Xenith - AI-Native Text Environment

Xenith is InferNode's text environment, a fork of the Acme editor optimized for AI agents and AI-human collaboration. The default GUI is Lucia ([LUCIA.md](LUCIA.md)).

## Overview

Xenith maintains Acme's elegant text-based philosophy while adding capabilities specifically designed for AI integration:

- **9P Filesystem Interface** - Agents interact via standard file operations
- **Namespace Security** - Capability-based access control for AI containment
- **Observable Operations** - All agent activity visible to humans
- **Multimodal Support** - Text and images in the same environment
- **Dark Mode** - Plan 9's colours (`glenda`) for light, a measured dark theme (`xenith`), or any system theme

## Why Xenith for AI?

### The Filesystem is the API

Unlike JSON-RPC protocols (MCP) or REST APIs, Xenith exposes everything as files:

```
/mnt/xenith/
├── new                  # Create window (write returns ID)
├── index                # One line per window: id, sizes, dirty, tag
└── <id>/
    ├── body             # Window text content
    ├── tag              # Title/command line
    ├── addr             # Text address (selection range)
    ├── data             # Text at addr, reading on to the end of the file
    ├── xdata            # Like data, but a read stops at the end of addr
    ├── errors           # Writes append to this directory's +Errors window
    ├── ctl              # Control commands (incl. dirty, menu, nomenu)
    ├── event            # Event stream
    ├── colors           # Per-window theming
    └── image            # Image display control
```

An AI agent reads and writes files. No SDK required. No parsing required. LLMs understand filesystem operations naturally.

### Namespace-Based Security

Inferno®'s namespace model provides capability-based security:

```limbo
# Agent sees only what you bind:
sys->bind("/mnt/llm", "/mnt/llm", Sys->MREPL);
sys->bind("/tools/safe", "/tools", Sys->MREPL);
sys->bind("/tmp/scratch", "/scratch", Sys->MCREATE);
# Nothing else exists from agent's perspective
```

Benefits:
- **Explicit grants** - Agent cannot access unbounded resources
- **Observable** - Human sees all namespace bindings
- **Dynamic** - Grant or revoke capabilities at runtime
- **No escape** - Namespace boundary is enforced by kernel

### Human-AI Collaboration

Xenith windows are shared workspaces:

```
┌─ Source Code ─────────────┐   ┌─ Agent Dialog ────────────┐
│ func main() {             │   │ Human: Add error handling │
│   // Code here            │   │ Agent: I'll wrap this in  │
│ }                         │   │ a try-catch block...      │
└───────────────────────────┘   └───────────────────────────┘
```

- Human edits appear as events to the agent
- Agent modifications are visible immediately
- Middle-click executes commands (Acme-style)
- Both parties work on the same text

## Features

### Themes

Xenith takes its colours from the system theme (`/lib/lucifer/theme`,
the same files every InferNode program uses) and follows it live: write
a theme's name to `/lib/lucifer/theme/current`, or pick one in Settings,
and Xenith recolours within a second, on the desktop or off it.

The `Theme` command (type it in a tag and middle-click, like `Font`)
switches: `Theme halo` to a named theme, `Theme` alone to the next one
installed.

`-t name` pins a session to one theme instead, which the system's
switches then leave alone; `Theme` in a pinned session changes that
session only. `tools/xen` starts Xenith pinned to `xenith`, the dark
theme: Xenith's original Catppuccin Mocha, corrected against the reading
research (dark grey behind off-white, every colour read as text at 7:1
or better, selections bright enough to see with the text on them still
at body contrast; [THEME-RESEARCH.md](THEME-RESEARCH.md) gives the
evidence, the numbers and the sources).
`glenda` is Plan 9's own colours, acme's to the pixel, and the light
theme to prefer; `-t plan9` and `-t acme` name it too.

```sh
xenith               # follow the system theme
xenith -t xenith     # this session: the xenith theme
xenith -t glenda     # this session: Plan 9's acme, exactly
```

A theme maps onto Xenith by role: body from the theme's `edit*` colours,
tags from `header` and `text`, selections from `menuhilit`, frame borders
from `accent` and `border`, and the button 2, button 3 and modified
colours from `red`, `green` and `yellow`. Any colour can still be set
directly with environment variables, which win over the theme, as
`acme-*` do in acme:

```sh
xenith-bg-text-0='#1E1E2E'	# body background
xenith-fg-text-0='#CDD6F4'	# body text
```

### Fonts

Xenith reads in Go and Go Mono, the faces Bigelow & Holmes (Lucida's
designers) drew for the Go project: a humanist sans and a slab-serif
monospace with the same x-height, so `Font` switches between them
without the text changing size, and with the characters code confuses
(`Il1|`, `0O`, `5S`, `8B`) drawn apart. Noto Serif, chosen for an
x-height that matches theirs, is the serif.

They are set at 14 pixels to the em, which puts the x-height at about
0.17 degrees on a laptop at 50 cm: above the critical print size, below
which reading slows, of readers into their late sixties, with a margin
for light text on dark. Larger buys no speed, only fewer lines on the
screen. 16 and 18 are for a monitor further away, or older eyes.
[THEME-RESEARCH.md](THEME-RESEARCH.md) has the evidence for the faces
and the size.

| Font file | Face |
|---|---|
| `/fonts/combined/go.14.font` | Go: the default |
| `/fonts/combined/gomono.14.font` | Go Mono: the fixed-width font, `Font` toggles to it |
| `/fonts/combined/serif.14.font` | Noto Serif |

Each is also built at 16 and 18 (`go.16.font`, `serif.18.font`, ...).
`Font` with a file name sets a window's font (`Font
/fonts/combined/serif.14.font`), and `-f` and `-F` (or the `xenith-font`
and `xenith-Font` environment variables) set the two defaults:

```sh
xenith -f /fonts/combined/serif.14.font		# serif by default
xenith -f /fonts/combined/go.16.font -F /fonts/combined/gomono.16.font	# larger
```

Characters the faces lack fall back to DejaVu. `tools/gen-text-fonts.py`
regenerates the bitmaps from the TrueType sources (Go's are in
`fonts/go`; the script says where to fetch Noto Serif's).

Go's other weights and slopes are built too, for setting documents
rather than editing them: `go.medium`, `go.bold`, `go.italic` and
`go.bolditalic`, at 14, 16, 18 and 22 (`go.bold.22.font`). `Font` does
not offer them. A program finds a style by putting its name before the
size in the regular face's file name, which is how Render's markdown
and HTML get real bold and italic, larger bold headings (22, 18 and 16
over a 14 body), medium table headers, and tables set with columns as
wide as their text, aligned as the separator row says, and ruled above,
below and under the header. Where a family lacks a style (DejaVu has
bold but no italic built), bold is drawn twice a pixel apart and italic
is underlined.

### Documents

A PDF, an image, a Mermaid diagram, Markdown and HTML set for reading,
and a web page are **documents**, all shown one way (see
[xenith-documents.md](xenith-documents.md) for the design). The
window's view stacks a document's sheets (a PDF's pages; one sheet for
a picture, or for a flowing document set to the window's width) in a
column, and:

- **scrolls** it with the wheel, the scroll bar (as Acme's: 1 back, 3
  on, 2 to a place) and Page Up/Down, Home and End, smoothly across
  page boundaries; button 1 **drags** it in both directions (grab and
  pan);
- **zooms** it: `Zoom+`, `Zoom-`, `Zoom n` (percent), `Fit` (a page's
  width to the window: a PDF opens so) and `Fit page` (a whole page in
  view: an image opens so). A PDF page is painted again at the scale,
  sharp, while the old painting is shown scaled meanwhile;
- goes to a page: `Page n`, `NextPage`, `PrevPage`;
- lets the **text on the drawing** be used, where the document knows
  where it drew it (PDF, Markdown): button 1 clicked without moving
  selects the word there, button 2 executes it, button 3 follows the
  link there or looks the word up (plumbed; if nothing takes it, found
  in the document and marked).

**Binary documents** (PDF, images) open as documents however they are
opened: plumbed, looked at, named on Xenith's command line, by Get, by
Load. The window's body is the document's text (a PDF's extracted
text), read-only: typing and writes to it are refused, and `Put` writes
it only to a file named (`Put /tmp/report.txt`), never over the PDF.
`Render` shows that text instead of the document, and back.

**Source documents** (Markdown, HTML, Mermaid) open as their text;
`Render` sets the text, unsaved edits and all, as the document, and
`Render` again goes back. The text is never changed: `Put` saves it,
programs reading the body see it, and typing goes back to it. Each
switch keeps your place in Markdown. For editing beside a live
preview, `Zerox` the window and `Render` one of the two: it is set
again as you edit in the other.

Markdown and Mermaid are set by `rlayout` (`appl/xenith/render/rlayout.b`),
the one typesetter, which Lucifer's presentation view uses too:
headings, emphasis, links, lists, quotes, code, tables and Mermaid
diagrams, in the window's colours. HTML is laid out by Charon's engine
(`appl/lib/web`), with its style sheets, fonts and images from the
file's directory and its own colours; there is no JavaScript. A URL
opened in Xenith is browsed (see [XEN.md](XEN.md#browsing)).

Nothing is loaded for a kind of document until one is opened: the
kinds are a table, `/lib/xenith/doctypes`, and each kind's engine
(`appl/xenith/doc/`) loads its own dependencies (the PDF interpreter,
`rlayout`, `mermaid`, Charon's engine) when it opens its first
document. Markdown and Mermaid never load Charon.

Every window's document is also its files, `/mnt/xenith/<id>/doc/`:

```
ctl	read: kind, class, name, shown, sheets, sheet, scale, fit,
	view (x y w h), screen (where the view is), column (w h);
	write: sheet n, scale n, fit [page], scroll dy, render, text,
	or any of the view's or the document's commands
text	the document's text
links	one link a line: sheet x0 y0 x1 y1 url
find	write a string; read where it was found: sheet x0 y0 x1 y1
```

```sh
echo 'image /path/to/diagram.png' > /mnt/xenith/1/ctl	# show a file as a document
cat /mnt/xenith/1/image		# its name and size: /path/to/diagram.png 800 600
echo 'scale 200' > /mnt/xenith/1/doc/ctl
echo clearimage > /mnt/xenith/1/ctl	# back to text
```

### Opening host files

`tools/xen file ...` runs Xenith by itself, dark and filling the emu
window, on files from the host; Exit ends the instance. See [XEN.md](XEN.md).

### Event Streams

Agents can monitor user activity:

```limbo
fd := sys->open("/mnt/xenith/1/event", Sys->OREAD);
for(;;) {
    n := sys->read(fd, buf, len buf);
    # Event format: "type origin q0 q1 flags length text"
    # React to user edits, selections, commands
}
```

Event types include insertions, deletions, selections, and command executions.

## Built-in Editor (`wm/editor`)

InferNode includes a standalone text editor with a modern feature set, accessible both from the GUI and via 9P for agent control.

### Features

- **Undo / Redo** — Ctrl-Z / Ctrl-Y with separate undo and redo stacks
- **Find & Replace** — Ctrl-F (find), Ctrl-H (find & replace), with wrap-around and replace-all
- **Selection** — Double-click selects word, triple-click selects line (400ms detection window)
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Unix cursor navigation (Ctrl-A/E/K/U), macOS Cmd shortcuts mapped to control chars
- **Status bar** — Shows file path, line/column, dirty indicator, search state

### 9P IPC Interface

The editor mounts a 9P filesystem for programmatic control, used by the Veltro `editor` tool:

```
/edit/
├── ctl              Global: open <path>, new, quit
├── index            List of open document IDs
└── {id}/
    ├── body         Document text (read/write)
    ├── ctl          Per-doc: save, saveas, goto, find, insert, delete, replace, replaceall
    ├── addr         Cursor position (read: "line col", write: set position)
    └── event        Blocking read for events (modified, opened, quit)
```

### Agent Integration

The Veltro `editor` tool uses IPC to let agents read, edit, and navigate open documents:

```sh
# Agent opens a file
echo 'open /appl/cmd/hello.b' > /edit/ctl

# Agent reads the document
cat /edit/1/body

# Agent inserts text at line 5, column 1
echo 'insert 5 1 # new comment' > /edit/1/ctl

# Agent finds and replaces
echo 'replaceall oldvar	newvar' > /edit/1/ctl    # tab-separated
```

## Usage

### Starting Xenith

```bash
# From InferNode
xenith

# With the dark theme
xenith -t xenith

# With a specific font
xenith -f /fonts/combined/serif.14.font
```

### Agent Interaction Example

```python
# Pseudocode for an AI agent

# 1. Create a window
write("/mnt/xenith/new/ctl", "scratch")
# Returns window ID, e.g., "3"

# 2. Write content
write("/mnt/xenith/3/body", "Analysis results:\n...")

# 3. Read user selection
selection = read("/mnt/xenith/3/rdsel")

# 4. Monitor events
for event in read_stream("/mnt/xenith/3/event"):
    if event.type == "insert":
        # User added text, respond...
```

### Mouse Chords (Acme Heritage)

- **B1 (Left)** - Select text
- **B2 (Middle)** - Execute selection as command
- **B3 (Right)** - Search/look up selection

## Design Philosophy

Xenith follows the principle: **"Minimal mechanism, maximal capability."**

From the Plan 9 tradition:
- Everything is a file
- Text is the universal interface
- Composition over configuration
- Small, sharp tools

Applied to AI:
- Filesystem operations are universal
- Observable beats opaque
- Human remains in control
- Capabilities are explicit

## Future Directions

Planned enhancements (see `IDEAS.md`):

- **Graphics languages** — `pic`, `grap` for diagrams
- **Audio support** — Voice I/O via `/dev/audio`
- **Structured data** — JSON/tree viewers
- **Token accounting** — LLM cost tracking
