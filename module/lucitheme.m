# lucitheme.m — Lucifer theme module interface
#
# Reads a colour palette from Plan 9–style flat files in
# /lib/lucifer/theme/.  Each key is a lowercase name, each
# value a 6-digit hex RGB string (alpha is always FF).
#
# Active theme is selected by /lib/lucifer/theme/current
# which contains a single theme name (e.g. "brimstone").
# Writing a name there switches every running program that
# watches it (watch, below), Lucifer or not.
#
# Users can create custom themes by adding files to this
# directory.  Missing keys fall back to Brimstone defaults.
