# gen-text-fonts.py — Xenith's reading faces as Inferno bitmap fonts.
#
# Renders Go, Go Mono (fonts/go) and Noto Serif (fonts/noto) at 14, 16
# and 18 pixels to the em, and at twice those into k8 subfonts, one per 256-codepoint block,
# and writes fonts/combined/{go,gomono,serif}.N.font. See
# docs/THEME-RESEARCH.md for why these faces and sizes. Go and Go Mono
# are also built for the fractional scales Wayland desktops use.
#
# Renders Go Medium, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic the same way, as
# fonts/combined/go.{medium,bold,italic,bolditalic}.N.font, at those
# sizes and 22 (and 44). A program finds a style by putting its name
# before the size in the regular face's file name.
#
# A font file sends a character to the first range holding it and does
# not fall through when the subfont lacks the glyph, so each manifest
# lists only the runs the face covers (with the offset of each run into
# its block's subfont), then DejaVu's manifest of the nearest size for
# everything else (libdraw aligns baselines across sizes).
#
# Line height is 1.25 em, or more if the faces' Latin-1 letters need it,
# the extra split above and below; every face at a size has the same
# height and ascent, and every subfont is rendered to them.
#
# Needs FreeType (for fonts/dejavu/ttf2subfont) and fontTools. Go's
# TrueType files are in fonts/go; Noto Serif's is not kept (fonts/noto
# ignores its sources), so fetch it first:
#   curl -L -o fonts/noto/NotoSerif-Regular.ttf \
#	https://github.com/notofonts/notofonts.github.io/raw/main/fonts/NotoSerif/hinted/ttf/NotoSerif-Regular.ttf
#
# Usage, from the root of the tree:
#   cc -O2 -o /tmp/ttf2subfont fonts/dejavu/ttf2subfont.c \
#	`pkg-config --cflags --libs freetype2`
#   python3 tools/gen-text-fonts.py /tmp/ttf2subfont
